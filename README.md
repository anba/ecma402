ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification (Ecma-402)
====

[Specification](http://tc39.github.io/ecma402/)


## Bug Reports 

We love bug reports, but this repo is for tracking proposals for new features. Please file bugs for the current specification or any future specification draft [here](https://bugs.ecmascript.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Internationalization%20-%20ECMA-402). I know that seems silly, but the Bugzilla site predates this Github account and that's where the entire bug report history of Ecma-402 already resides.


## Current Proposals
ES Intl Proposals follow [this process document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QbEE0BsO4lvl7NFTn5WXWeiEIBfaVUF7Dk0hpPpPDzU).
